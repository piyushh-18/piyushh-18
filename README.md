Hi, I’m Piyush Kumar

Aspiring Data Scientist

I’m a BCA student at KCC Institute of Technology & Management, currently focused on building practical skills in Data Science.

I like working with data, understanding patterns, and turning raw information into something useful. Instead of just learning concepts, I prefer applying them through projects where I can see how things work in real scenarios.

I have worked on projects like an AI-powered ATS Resume Screening System and Real Estate Price Prediction, where I handled data preprocessing, model building, and basic deployment using Python and related tools. I’m continuously improving my skills by building, breaking, and rebuilding projects.
